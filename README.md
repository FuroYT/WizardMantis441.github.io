- [icon splitter](https://github.com/WizardMantis441/WizardMantis441.github.io/blob/main/fnf/icon-splitter.html), put in an iconGrid and it will cut it into pieces of 300 x 150
- [psych char to cne char converter](https://github.com/WizardMantis441/WizardMantis441.github.io/blob/main/fnf/p2cne-character.html), put in a psych json and it kinda makes a cne xml somewhat well?
- (outdated) [ninji leaderboards](https://github.com/WizardMantis441/WizardMantis441.github.io/blob/main/ocw/ninji.html) - shout out ocw for having a goated community and helping me learn web making in general o7
