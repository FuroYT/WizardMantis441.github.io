      <h1>My School Notes (I have AP Comp Sci)</h1>
      
      <h2>1.1 - Computer Programs (2)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Computer Program - Tells a computer, in minute detail, the sequence of steps that are needed to fulfill a task.</li>
        <li>Hardware - The physical computer and peripheral devices.</li>
        <li>Software - The programs the computer executes.</li>
        <li>Programming - The act of designing and implementing computer programs.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>1.2 - The Anatomy of a Computer (3)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CPU - Central Processing Unit: composed of "transistors", locates and executes the program instructions, does the math, etc.</li>
        <li>Hard Disk - Used for "secondary storage", can persist without electricity.</li></li>
        <li>Networks - Allows the computer to read data and programs from central storage locations or send data to other computers.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>1.3 - The Java Programming Language (6)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Java - A high-level programming language.</li>
        <li>Compiler - Translates the high-level instructions into the more detailed instructions, "machine code", required for the CPU.</li>
        <li>Applets - Java code that can be located anywhere on the internet. <a href="https://jmol.sourceforge.net/">EXAMPLE</a></li>
        <li>Java Library - Makes it possible to write portable programs that can bypass proprietary operating systems.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>1.4 - Becoming Familiar with Your Programming Environment (8)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hello World - Simple Example</li>
        <pre>
          <code>
public class HelloPrinter {
            
  public static void main(String[] args) {
            
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
            
  }
            
}
          </code>
        </pre>
